## 📖 About the Project

Farmstellar is designed to promote sustainable farming practices

We built this project because sustainable farming methods exist, but adoption is low due to lack of guidance, motivation, and youth involvement — so we created a system that breaks practices into simple quests, rewards progress, and makes sustainability easier to start, track, and maintain.

### Key Features

- ✨ Quests: tasks that makes you learn sustainable farming through real life practices.
- ✨ AI Chatbot: a multilingual AI chatbot with AI quest generation.
- ✨ Community: a personalised community system meant for farmers to share their works

## 🧪 Local Dev: Proxy to Express Backend

- **Purpose**: During local development the Next.js dev server can proxy requests under `/api/*` to the local Express server running on port `4000` so the frontend can call the backend without changing request URLs.
- **How it works**: `next.config.ts` contains a development-only rewrite that proxies `/api/:path*` to `http://localhost:4000/api/:path*`.
- **If you prefer absolute URLs**: Create a `.env.local` file with:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

Then, use `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` in the frontend when building absolute API URLs.

If you run the Express server on another port, update `next.config.ts` or set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` accordingly.
